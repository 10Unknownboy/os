# 💖 Love OS  
### Because texting "I miss you" is too basic.

Welcome to **Love OS** — the only place where your love, delusion, and commitment issues get their own operating system.

Why just say *"I love you"* on WhatsApp…  
when you can deploy a full romantic desktop ecosystem with floating hearts, secret unlock codes, analytics dashboards, and a terminal that hacks feelings?

Yes.  
We built infrastructure for emotions.
